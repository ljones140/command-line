grep

grep is arguably the most useful command in shell. use is for searching in files
Basic use:
==
grep filename search_expression
==

However it is far more useful when piped | into other shell commands.
for example it can be used with ls to search directory names:
==
ls haystack | needle
==

Can also be used to check running processes BUT make sure you cancel out grep itself so you don't see it's result
==
ps -x | grep Chrome | grep -v Chrome
==

 -v is switch to ignore rather than search
